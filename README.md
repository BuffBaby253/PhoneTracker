# This code will track accurately where a mobile device is with only a phone number
**After running it will print out the state (assumming in America) longitude & latitude and create an html file that shows a map of the coordinates**

> [!NOTE]
> change the phone number in ***phonenumber.py*** to the number you want to hunt
> change the API key in ***line 25 in main.py*** to your API key from [OpenCageData](https://opencagedata.com) **you will need to make an account**
